    	<h1>Clean Bandit - Extraordinary</h1>
    	<p>You can see there's something in the way
			I've tried to show you, my door is open
			I don't know how much more I can take
			Since you've chosen, to leave me frozen
			Am I the only one, who see's what you've become?
			Will you drift away?
			We're running out if time, two wrongs can make it right
			Could I make you stay?
			People making choices they can't fake
			Sacrifice it all and maybe say</p>
    	<p>Something extraordinary
			Something real (something real)
			To fill my days and nights with something
			That I can feel (I can feel)
			I'm not gonna compromise
			Surely you can simplify?
			Say you feel the same</p>
    	<p>You've wondered down a path I can't explain
		Have you seen her, the grass is greener
		To let me pass you by would be a shame
		If she's your only then why you lonely?
		Cos I'm the only one, who know the things you've done
		I'm so good for you
		We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
		Could I make you do</p>
	 <p>Something extraordinary
			Something real (something real)
			To fill my days and nights with something
			That I can feel (I can feel)
			I'm not gonna compromise
			Surely you can simplify?
			Say you feel the same</p>
